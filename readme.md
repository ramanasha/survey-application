Surveys are very important in this data driven world. Most of the survey creating and
integrating applications used nowadays are less user friendly.

The Aim of the project is to create an online survey management application 
which user can use to create survey and also to collect answers from survey.

this project is a single page application

Technologies used are ​ - HTML5, CSS , Javascript, AngularJS, Bootstrap

Features of the platform -
1) Survey Management Part managed by Admin(you)
2) Survey running part used by End User

1) Survey Management Part
	a) A view to create a survey - In this view admin should be able to create a survey.
		Give it a tile, subtitle and description. You can use API number 1 for this purpose
	b) A view to view all surveys - In this view admin should be able to view a list of all
		surveys. API number 2 can be used here
	c) A view to see details of a particular survey. You have to display all the data you
		are getting except the _id or _v field. API number 3 can be used here
	d) Edit a particular survey - This view should allow to edit details like title, subtitle
		and description for a particular survey. API number 4 can be used.
	e) Delete a particular survey - Admin should be able to delete a particular survey
		from both the views in point 1(b) and 1(c). API number - 5
	f) Create a question in survey - Admin should be able to create a question in a
		survey through this view. You can use API number 6 for this
	g) Create an option for a survey - Each question in survey can have multiple
		choices/options to choose from. You can use API number 10 for creating an
		option
	h) Admin should be able to delete options and questions also. Check API doc for
		the required APIs

2) Survey running part - User end
	a) View to display a survey by Id - user will be directly given this link to
		start the survey. You can include a welcome screen with survey title
		and description
	b) View of each question in which user should be able to select an
		option.
	c) Once the user has selected the answer, you have to send that
		answer to API 12 and then the screen should display the next
		question in the survey
	d) User should have option to skip the question. Number “0” should be
		passed as answer in that
	e) At the end of the survey, display a Thank you message.


A few important points which i made use of-
	1) Run the APIs in POSTMAN once to see the response format. That will enable you to
		easily use that in your Angular code
	2) The whole application should be single page with well defined View, controllers,
		directives and services.
	3) Follow modern design guidelines while creating the view.
	4) Admin can be less intuitive, but try to make user experience as intuitive as you can
